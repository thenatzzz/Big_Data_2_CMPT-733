    "Data scientists often need to crawl data from websites and turn the crawled data (HTML pages) to structured data (tables). Thus, web scraping is an essential skill that every data scientist should master. In this assignment, you will learn the followings:\n",

    "* How to download HTML pages from a website?\n",
    "* How to extract relevant content from an HTML page? \n",

    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please use [pandas.DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) rather than spark.DataFrame to manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Please use [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) rather than [lxml](http://lxml.de/) to parse an HTML page and extract data from the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Please follow python code style (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). If TA finds your code hard to read, you will lose points. This requirement will stay for the whole semester."
