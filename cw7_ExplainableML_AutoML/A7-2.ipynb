    "# Assignment 7: Automated Machine Learning (Part 2)\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned from the class, the high demand for machine learning has produced a large amount of data scientists who have developed expertise in tools and algorithms. The features in the data will directly influence the results. However, it is tedious and unscalable to manually design and select features without domain knowledge. Thus, using some AutoML techniques will significantly help data scientists save labour and time. \n",
    "After completing this assignment, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why do we need AutoML?\n",
    "2. How does auto feature generation work?\n",
    "3. How to use featuretools library to automatically generate features?\n",
    "4. How to get useful features in a large feature space?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a data scientist in an online retailer company, for example, Amazon. Your task is to provide some recommendations to customers based on their historical purchase records.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we predict whether the customer will buy **Banana** in the next 4 weeks. It is a classification problem. To simplify the problem, we have already generated some features and provide the accuracy of the model (Random Forest model). The task for you is to generate **10** useful features and beat our model performance (AUC = 0.61, see below). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, <br>\n",
    "`MODE(orders.MODE(order_products.product_name)) = Bag of Organic Bananas` means whether the most frequent purchase of the customer is Bag of Organic Bananas. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1: Feature: MODE(orders.MODE(order_products.product_name)) = Bag of Organic Bananas\n",
    "2: Feature: MODE(order_products.aisle_id) is unknown\n",
    "3: Feature: SUM(orders.NUM_UNIQUE(order_products.product_name))\n",
    "4: Feature: MODE(orders.MODE(order_products.product_name)) = Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts\n",
    "5: Feature: MODE(order_products.product_name) = Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts\n",
    "6: Feature: STD(orders.NUM_UNIQUE(order_products.aisle_id))\n",
    "7: Feature: MODE(order_products.aisle_id) = 83\n",
    "8: Feature: MEDIAN(orders.MINUTE(order_time))\n",
    "9: Feature: MODE(orders.DAY(order_time)) = 23\n",
    "10: Feature: MODE(orders.MODE(order_products.department)) = produce\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC 0.61\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminary\n",

    "--- Write your answer here---\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "1. Powerful tools: Using concepts of Entitysets, Entities, and Relationships, Featuretools can perform Deep Feature Synthesis to create new features. In addition, for complex datasets where there several entities with parent/child relationships, Featuretools helps save us lots of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open-source: it is free to use with constant contribution from Data Scientist community.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Time Handling: Deep Feature Synthesis in Featuretools can automatically calculate the features for each training example at the specific time associated with the example by using cutoff times. This leads to fewer label leakage problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages,and How to improve:\n",
    "1. In-memory: According to Featuretools doc, Featuretools is intended to be run on datasets that can fit in memory on one machine. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Improvement: Featuretools has document for you on how to run on computationally expensive task such as Reduce number of unique cutoff times, Adjust chuck size, Partition and Distribute Data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prices: If you want to work on very big datasets by using Apache Spark and Dask, you might need to pay for Featuretools Enterprise APIs. Or else, you need to build the whole system by yourself.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Improvement: Featuretools allow you test their native Enterprise APIs before paying money. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Supervised Learning: If you are doing supervised machine learning, you must specify and supply your own labels.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Improvement: You can use external tools or you can use 'Compose' tools offered by Featuretools to supply labels."
