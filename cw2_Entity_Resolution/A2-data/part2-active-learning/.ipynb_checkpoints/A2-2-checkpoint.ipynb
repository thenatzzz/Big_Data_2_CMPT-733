    "[Active learning](http://tiny.cc/al-wiki) is a certain type of ML algorithms that can train a high-quality ML model with small data-labeling cost. Its basic idea is quite easy to understand. Consider a typical supervised ML problem, which requires a (relatively) large training dataset. In the training dataset, there may be only a small number of data points that are beneficial to the trained ML model. In other words, labeling a small number of data points is enough to train a high-quality ML model. The goal of active learning is to help us to identify those data points. \n",

The algorithm trains an initial model on `labeled_pairs`. Then, it iteratively trains a model. At each iteration, it first applies the model to `unlabeled_pairs`, and makes a prediction on each unlabeled pair along with a probability, where the probability indicates the confidence of the prediction. After that, it selects the most uncertain pair (If there is still a tie, break it randomly),  and call the `crowdsroucing()` function to label the pair. After the pair is labeled, it updates `labeled_pairs` and `unlabeled_pairs`, and then retrain the model on `labeled_pairs`.\n",
